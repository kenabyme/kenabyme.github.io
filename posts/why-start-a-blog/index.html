			<p>I figure a good first post for a blog is an explanation of why the blog exists in the
first place. Why do it? I want to start blogging for a simple reason: I want to write
more often and I think it&rsquo;s more fun to write where other people can read what you say.
I hope that having this public space inspires me to do that.</p>
<p><strong>What&rsquo;s with the name?</strong></p>
<p><em>ybane.me</em> is a partially reversed version of <em>en abyme</em>, which is a phrase I borrowed
from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mise_en_abyme">Mise en abyme</a> which is an artistic technique of placing a copy of an image within
itself in such a way that suggests infinite recursion. I&rsquo;m reminded of this effect when I
think about how my life involves a continual pursuit to live according to my own values
while also satisyfing the expectations of the people I love. By resisting and satisfying
those expecations, I both change and reinforce them. I&rsquo;m a reflection of the people around
me as much as they are a reflection of me. Much like standing between two mirrors that are
facing one another, my values are always changing as a result of this push and pull, and
the effects of this tension are infinite: they will continue for the rest of my life.</p>
